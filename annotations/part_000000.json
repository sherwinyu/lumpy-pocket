When we wake up in the morning, we make an immediate, unconscious forecast. We know what to expect from our day and that expectation, although completely biased by our current mood, sets the tone for the day. A bad mood will anticipate all the bad things the day has in store and give us a gloomy outlook. A good mood will make the day look promising. These forecasts are so biased because moods feel like they will go on forever, but they don’t. Moods change like the weather. Unlike the weather, we can influence our mood, so by making that unconscious forecast conscious, we can change it.\nMaking the unconscious, conscious is a very small step, but it can make a world of difference. With a mood, a moment of conscious reflection is the difference between things being awful, and things feeling awful. The unconscious reaction to difficult feelings is to push them away. The conscious response is to feel the feelings and stick with them long enough to see what they are about. Taking that step involves noticing the feelings and, even though they are painful, holding them for a moment. In that moment of conscious acceptance, as we look inward, we get insights into what we can do to feel better.\nThe specific insight that our mood is a mood and not a reflection of how things are, creates an opening to let a mood pass.
